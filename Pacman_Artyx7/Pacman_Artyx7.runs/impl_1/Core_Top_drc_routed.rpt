Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_gen_0/sim_6M[0].inst/in0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_gen_0/sim_6M[0].inst/Qn/O, cell clk_gen_0/sim_6M[0].inst/Qn. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_Core/o_cpu_di_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_Core/o_cpu_di_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell u_Core/o_cpu_di_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk_gen_0/sim_6M[0].inst/Qn is driving clock pin of 14 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[0], u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[1],
u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[2], u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[3],
u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[4], u_Core/u_audio/accum_reg_reg[5],
u_Core/u_audio/audio_vol_out_reg[0], u_Core/u_audio/audio_vol_out_reg[1],
u_Core/u_audio/audio_vol_out_reg[2], u_Core/u_audio/audio_vol_out_reg[3],
u_Core/u_audio/audio_wav_out_reg[0], u_Core/u_audio/audio_wav_out_reg[1],
u_Core/u_audio/audio_wav_out_reg[2], u_Core/u_audio/audio_wav_out_reg[3]
